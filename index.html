    <h2 class="me">Who Am I? Why Programming?</h2>
      <p class="p1">Hi! My name is Cody Hogg. I am 23 years old and live in Sherwood, Arkansas. I have 3 children, a lovely wife, and 2 great dogs. My interest for programming began around
        the summer of 2022, after working 70-80 hour weeks, I decided I needed something new. I discovered programming from social media videos
        talking about how the job provided a great work/life balance, which is what I was needing. I learned programing from
        a variety of online courses, Codecademy, CS50, ZerotoMastery, mainly focusing my studies on Front-end development.
        As for a job, i'm open to any position. My main goal for my first job as a programmer is to find myself with a 
        company who not only is well respected in the tech industry, but also is known for their teaching to their junior
        and intern developers. I am new to the programming world, however, I am a dedicated learner and spend a lot of time
        mastering the knowledge of whatever field I am in.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h2 class="knowledge">What do I Know?</h2>
       <p class="p2">When I first started looking into software engineering, I was taken aback by the variety of positions involved.
          From what I knew, I thought it was all the same, just simply typing code to make stuff happen. I quickly found out how wrong I was.
          I have previous experiance with web-design on Wordpress, dealing with my families company and developing a simple
          site, with intentions of describing our company and what we do. I have listed the site above, labeled "Wordpress Page". 
       </p>
       <br>
       <p class="p3"> As far as my knowledge of actual programming, I have studied the basics of front-end: html, css, java, git, react.
         As well as learning about things such as color cordination and text to make the site more user friendly. I believe my 
         experiance in my families business helps me with this quite a bit, as I not only did the web design, but also was in 
         charge of the in store marketing. This allowed me to understand the connection between customers and a product and 
         how to grab their attention to something while also making sure to not devalue other things in store or on the site.
